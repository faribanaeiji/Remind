Background:
The patient is a female marketing coordinator in her late 20s presenting for evaluation of anxiety. She has been experiencing heightened anxiety for the past several years, particularly in social and work-related situations. Despite her ongoing anxiety, she has never sought professional help before. After encountering increasing difficulties with daily functioning—particularly with work performance and social interactions—she decided to seek treatment. The patient has completed an anxiety screening questionnaire as part of the psychiatrist’s intake process and is looking for ways to manage the anxiety that is impacting her personal and professional life.

Psychiatrist: Thank you for coming in today. I’d like to ask you some questions about how you experience anxiety. These questions will help me understand your symptoms better, and we can talk about how it affects different parts of your life. Let’s start with general anxiety. How often do you find yourself feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge?

Patient: Hmm, pretty often, I guess. It’s been going on for a few years now. I think I feel anxious at least every day, sometimes for no reason at all.

Psychiatrist: That’s a good place to start. Can you describe what that anxiety feels like for you? Is it more of a feeling, or do you notice any physical symptoms?

Patient: It’s both. I definitely feel it in my chest, like a tightness or pressure. My heart races, and sometimes I start sweating. It happens mostly when I have to speak in front of people or when I have a deadline coming up. But honestly, even when I’m just sitting at home, I can feel it creeping up.

Psychiatrist: I see. So, the physical symptoms sound pretty intense. Have you noticed if this feeling happens in particular situations, or does it come up randomly?

Patient: It’s usually when I’m in social situations, like work meetings or gatherings with people I don’t know very well. It gets worse if I think people are judging me. But sometimes it happens when I’m just at home alone, thinking about all the things I have to do. It’s like my mind won’t stop racing, and I can’t calm down.

Psychiatrist: It sounds like your anxiety is triggered both by external situations and by your own thoughts. How does this anxiety affect your ability to function day-to-day?

Patient: Honestly, it makes everything harder. At work, I struggle to focus because I’m too worried about what other people think. I’ll have moments when I can’t make a decision or get paralyzed by the thought of making the wrong choice. Sometimes, I avoid going out with friends or colleagues because I’m afraid something will go wrong.

Psychiatrist: I hear you. It sounds like anxiety is affecting both your work and your social life. Do you ever find yourself avoiding situations or places because of this anxiety?

Patient: Yes, definitely. Like I said, I skip social events sometimes because I feel too anxious about how I’ll come across. I’ve also canceled plans last minute because I start imagining the worst-case scenarios. And at work, I’ll avoid meetings if I know I’ll have to present something. I just don’t want to deal with the anxiety it causes.

Psychiatrist: Avoidance is a common response to anxiety, but it sounds like it might be limiting your opportunities. Have you noticed any patterns in your physical health related to your anxiety, like trouble sleeping or changes in appetite?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve had trouble sleeping for a while. I can’t fall asleep easily because my mind races, and when I do sleep, I wake up a lot during the night. I think it’s part of why I feel so drained during the day. My appetite has been up and down too. Some days I eat to try to calm myself down, other days I forget to eat because I’m too stressed out to think about it.

Psychiatrist: That sounds very exhausting. The fatigue from not sleeping properly can definitely make it harder to cope with anxiety. Have you noticed any specific worries or thoughts that seem to trigger your anxiety?

Patient: It’s mostly about what people think of me. I constantly worry that I’m not doing enough or that I’m going to mess something up. I also think about the future a lot—like what will happen if I don’t succeed, or if I disappoint others. It’s like this constant feeling that something is wrong, but I can’t figure out what exactly.

Psychiatrist: It seems like a lot of your anxiety is tied to fears of judgment and failure. How do you usually cope when you start to feel anxious?

Patient: I try to distract myself with something else, like watching TV or scrolling through my phone, but that doesn’t always help. Sometimes I’ll take deep breaths or try to meditate, but it’s hard to stay focused. Other times, I just try to push through it and ignore it, but that usually backfires.

Psychiatrist: It sounds like you’ve tried a few different methods to cope with anxiety. Are there any moments when you feel a bit of relief or find things to get better?

Patient: Well, when I’m alone and I can take a break, it sometimes helps to just be by myself in a quiet space. But I still feel like the anxiety lingers, even when I try to relax.

Psychiatrist: It’s good to hear that you’ve found some moments of calm. It’s important to have strategies that work for you, though it sounds like it’s been tough to find lasting relief. You mentioned a history of feeling anxious. Do you remember when this started?

Patient: I think it started in high school, actually. I was always nervous about schoolwork and socializing, but it got a lot worse when I went to college. That’s when the pressure really started to build up.

Psychiatrist: So, this anxiety has been around for quite some time. Do you think it’s worsened over the years, or has it stayed about the same?

Patient: I think it’s gotten worse. In high school, I could deal with it better, but now, it feels like it’s everywhere. It’s like the anxiety is always there, even if I’m doing something fun or relaxing.

Psychiatrist: I understand. It seems like anxiety has really started to take up a lot of your mental space. How about in your relationships? Has anxiety affected how you interact with close friends or family?

Patient: Yeah, sometimes I avoid opening up to people because I don’t want to seem weak. It’s hard for me to talk about how anxious I feel because I don’t want them to think I’m overreacting. I know it’s probably a problem, but I feel like I should just handle it on my own.

Psychiatrist: That’s understandable. But it sounds like keeping everything inside is creating some tension. It might help to be able to talk more openly about these feelings. Would you say that anxiety impacts your overall quality of life?

Patient: Definitely. It’s hard to enjoy things fully because I’m constantly worried about what could go wrong. It feels like I’m always on alert. I just want to feel more relaxed and present, but I’m not sure how to get there.

Psychiatrist: Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It sounds like your anxiety is affecting many parts of your life, and I can see how it’s become something that’s hard to manage on your own. We can definitely explore ways to help you find relief and improve your coping strategies.
